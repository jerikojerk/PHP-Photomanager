# PHP-Photomanager


##reduire_images 
This project is a script to allow someone to resize multiple images at once. it is based on PHP's GD.
It will saves you from going into Gimp and loading the picture, resize, export .... 

main purpose is to get smaller image => less pixel => smaller size (less octets) => easier to add in webpage form or as mail.

Quality of resulting image may be improved, ... probably.
